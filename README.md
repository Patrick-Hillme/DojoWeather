This was an assignment from Coding Dojo to replicate a web page that displays the weather. 

The goal was to create the site itself and style it with CSS to look as close to the proposed site as possible. This included spacing and coloring. 

After that I was to use JavaScript to make it so that when any of the three cities were clicked on the top ribbon it would display the same alert for each. Next an onclick() that made the cookie box go away when the button was clicked. And lastly to make a function that would enable the user to choose between celcius and fahrenheit and have it display the temperature accordingly.
